## Process
We started out with the base code given. We then met together and discussed the project on what we wanted to add. After that, we divied up the requirements to the group. There was a lot of refactoring that took place. We worked together doing pair programming to help debug and make new developments. 

### Jason
Restructured the index file. Created the start and learn more screen, the mute button, favicon, and healthbar.

### Dodge
Created the end game sound using the Audio() class and the high score screen with persistent data
utilizing local storage, and lots of CSS styling

### Blake
Refactoring the code into a more reusable code base and create class hierarchy and reduce the amount of repeated code. Managed the code base and branch merges
